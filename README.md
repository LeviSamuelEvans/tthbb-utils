# ttHbb_legacy_utilities

This repository contains useful scripts for the ttH(bb) Run 2 Legacy analysis. This includes a python script for submitting batch jobs, in this case designed for the histogram generation
in TRExFitter, which needs to be parallelised when running using the full systematics model. Scripts to assist in downloading the "Level-1" Ntuples are also here.
